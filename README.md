# ChatApp
chat app created used MongoDB(to display all records of texts between others), Node.js, Visual Studio (to code the app). To test the app go to this website: https://shielded-lowlands-74816.herokuapp.com/. Enjoy and send comments.

Note: since github wont let me add every single file i just added the main files. Again go to this website to test the code: https://shielded-lowlands-74816.herokuapp.com/. (everything works)
All cloud credits go to Heroku
